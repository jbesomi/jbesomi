👋 Hi, my name is Jonathan, I'm NLP data scientist and like to mine _unstructured_ data such as text data.

- I'm the author of [Texthero](https://github.com/jbesomi/texthero), a simple python tool to deal with text data efficiently
- I'm a teaching assistant at the [Data Science for Managers Network](https://github.com/dsfm-org)
- I'm an AI consultant, specialized in NLP and text mining

I believe the future of NLP and ML is in analyzing and find insights from large amounts of unstructured data. If you have the same idea, then drop me a line, it might be a match 👍 (spoiler: I'm about to start an AI startup ...)
